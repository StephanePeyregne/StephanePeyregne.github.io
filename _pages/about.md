Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Understanding human biology and health has advanced rapidly thanks to the wealth of genomic, medical, and functional datasets available today. An evolutionary perspective adds a powerful dimension to these efforts by illuminating the processes that shaped our biology and explaining how and why we became who we are.

In particular, ancient genomes, including those of Neandertals and Denisovans, provide access to chapters of our evolution that were previously out of reach with present-day data alone. By integrating these ancient genomes with modern datasets, we aim to identify the genetic changes that shaped the modern human lineage and investigate their significance for human biology and health.
