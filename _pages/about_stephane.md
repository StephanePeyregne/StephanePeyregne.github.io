Stéphane is a CNRS researcher and group leader at the Institut Jacques Monod. A former student of the École Normale Supérieure de Lyon, he obtained his PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology under the supervision of Kay Prüfer and Svante Pääbo (Nobel Prize 2022), where he identified key genetic changes around the emergence of modern humans and reconstructed the history of Neandertals living around 120,000 years ago. He then carried out postdoctoral research with Benjamin Peter, developing a model of ancient DNA damage to estimate present-day human DNA contamination and describing ancient admixture events between modern humans and Neandertals around 200,000 years ago. He continued his postdoctoral work with Janet Kelso to reconstruct new Denisovan genomes, including the second high-quality Denisovan genome from an individual who lived 200,000 years ago.

His research combines paleogenomics and evolutionary analysis to reconstruct human population history and to understand when and how genetic variants relevant to human traits and disease arose, using human evolution as a framework for insights into present-day biology and health.
